# sample-code
I included some of my past coding samples using Python (some were done in Jupyter Notebook), MATLAB and R. The code files were uploaded in folders accordingly. Respective reports for some code files were included.

For two of the codes (Lab 2 and 3) under geophysical computational method, I collaborated with my classmate Cole Narfason. We will both try and write our own code first, then we would compare and help each other in terms of what's missing and what else is needed to make sure that we manage to solve the numerical problems and plot the graphs nicely. 

For physical properties of rock class, the completion of assignment can just be done using Excel, however, I want to try and test my coding skills in Python, hence, I try to complete specific questions from assignments using Python through Jupyter Notebook.

For Google Data Analytics Certificate, I use R to process and clean the data as well as the visualizations.

For gravity & magnetics and geophysics signal processing, I mainly use MATLAB to complete the lab assignments.
